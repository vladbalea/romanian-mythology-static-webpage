            <h1>Romanian mythology & folklore</h1>
            <p>
                A feature of Romanian culture is the special relationship between folklore and the learned culture, determined by two factors.
                First, the rural character of the Romanian communities resulted in an exceptionally vital and creative traditional culture.
                Folk creations (the best known is the ballad Miori»õa) were the main literary genre until the 18th century.
                They were both a source of inspiration for cultivated creators and a structural model.
                Second, for a long time learned culture was governed by official and social commands and developed around courts of princes and boyars, as well as in monasteries.
